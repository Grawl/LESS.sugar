#LESS sugar for Espresso

[LESS](http://lesscss.org) extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions. LESS runs on both the client-side (IE 6+, Webkit, Firefox) and server-side, with Node.js.

This sugar is first working solution that I ever seen for LESS. I found it [in twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/grawlcore/status/133096087908134912). I look into it and found that it is a hawx's LESS.sugar, but this version is works, in contrast with sugar that is available in the hawx's repository.

Known LESS.sugar repos:
- [hawx's LESS.sugar](https://github.com/hawx/LESS.sugar) (similiar to this repo, but not working)
- [yoshokatana's LESS.sugar](https://github.com/yoshokatana/LESS.sugar) (not working yet, hope it will work in future)
- [elliottcable's LESS.sugar](https://github.com/elliottcable/LESS.sugar) (nothing created, dummy repo)
